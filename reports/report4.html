            <h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my co-op work-term report for work-term 4. I will be describing information about my employer, my experience working for them, my job responsibilities, listing my learning goals and my reflections of them, and acknowledging the people that made this experience possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the computer science department at Algoma. My contributions involved 3 separate research projects in computing: 2 of them being cutting-edge machine learning projects, and the remaining being a genome-wide association study (GWAS) project.

            <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>

            <p>
                Algoma University is not a common Canadian university because of its deep ties to the "Indigenous peoples" of Canada. By "Indigenous peoples", I am referring to the 3 legally recognized groups of people: First Nations, Inuit, and Metis, in Canada. Notably, the university's Sault Ste. Marie campus is built on the former Shingwauk Indian Residential School site as a project to foster the growth and development of the Shingwauk site. This Shingwauk site used to be home to one of Canada's many Indian Residential Schools, which makes the history of Algoma's Salt Ste. Marie campus even more culturally and historically significant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Algoma University has 3 campuses: Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins, and Brampton. Sault Ste. Marie and Timmins are the university's "Northen Ontario" locations whereas Brampton is the university's urban campus. The university's main campus is the Sault Ste. Marie one, which is why it is referred to as a "Northen Ontario" university. Technically, Professor Randy Lin works at the Bramptom campus, but I never managed to work on campus because I was working remotely for my work-term. That being said, the Brampton campus is situated in downtown Brampton, making it within reach of Toronto, and well within the confines of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
            </p>
            <p>
               Professor Randy Lin has a very diverse academic computing background: bioinformatics and computer graphics mainly come to mind, if you read his published research. I worked with him on a computer graphics project that uses machine learning techniques such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models to approximate recreations of existing and new 3D meshes. Computer graphics is a developing subfield of computer science, and getting to integrate novel machine learning approaches to it was the highlight of my work-term. His expertise, alongside the expertise of his graduate student, Bamikole "Banki" Adewale, were invaluable in helping me learn so much more about the ins and outs of computer graphics, and the power machine learning has to enhance this field, especially if used responsibly and ingeniously. From what I remember, the project would eventually be used to readily and cheaply construct realistic 3D environments in virtual reality settings by Algoma's psychology department. Thusly, this research project was an interdisciplinary research project, especially in the application side of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                While working for Professor Lin and Banki on the computer graphics project, I was focused on finding useful bioinformatics applications for a large language model (LLM) trained on bioinformatics datasets, called "AgroNT" under Professor Yan Yan's co-supervision. Professor Yan is one of the experts in bioinformatics at the School of Computer Science (SoCS) at the University of Guelph (UoG), and has co-authored multiple papers with Professor Lin in the past, which is how the acquaintance was made.

            <h2>GOALS AND THEIR DETAILS</h2>
            <img src="../images/chatgpt_o4_goal0.png" alt="Research and Development Goals" id="goals-photo">

            <!-- Learning Goal 1 -->
            <h4>Learning Goal 1</h4>
            <p>To develop a command-line interface (CLI) pipeline for a deep learning machine learning model (called 'AgroNT').</p>
            <h4>Action Plan 1</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Design and implement a CLI pipeline for the AgroNT deep learning model to predict gene expression levels without alignment requirements</li>
                <li>Create comprehensive Unified Modeling Language (UML) documentation for system design</li>
                <li>Develop system components using Golang, Python, and R per technical specifications</li>
                <li>Conduct thorough system testing across various conditions</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Measure of Success 1</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>System performs consistently according to technical specifications</li>
                <li>Interface is user-friendly across specified platforms</li>
                <li>Complete documentation exists (UML, code, and usage)</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Reflection 1</h4>
            <p>
                While my original goal involved developing a CLI pipeline for AgroNT, circumstances necessitated a pivot to another machine learning project under Professor Randy Lin's supervision. Instead of the intended gene expression prediction model, I successfully designed and implemented a CLI pipeline for a 3D mesh downscaler and upscaler project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using Python, I developed a system that automatically downscales/distorts 3D meshes from open-license databases like ShapeNet to create supervised training datasets for machine learning models such as NeRFs. The pipeline incorporated various open-source tools including pymeshlab and blender, demonstrating my ability to adapt to changing project requirements while maintaining technical rigor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although my involvement concluded at the NeRF dataset adaptation and conversion stage due to budgetary constraints, the project achieved significant progress. Professor Lin expressed high satisfaction with the completed work, validating that I successfully met the core technical objectives of designing and implementing a functional CLI pipeline for a machine learning application, albeit in a different domain than originally planned.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience highlighted the importance of flexibility in technical development while maintaining focus on delivering a reliable, well-documented system that meets user needs. The skills developed during this process—particularly in pipeline design, system integration, and technical documentation—will prove valuable in future software engineering endeavors regardless of the specific application domain.
            </p>

            <!-- Learning Goal 2 -->
            <h4>Learning Goal 2</h4>
            <p>Read up on technical documentation on the development tools, libraries, and frameworks that I will use to build my project.</p>
            <h4>Action Plan 2</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Study technical documentation for all project technology stack components</li>
                <li>Apply learned concepts to inform project design and implementation</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Measure of Success 2</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Implementation demonstrates effective use of tools based on official documentation</li>
                <li>Demonstrated improvement in technical documentation comprehension skills</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Reflection 2</h4>
            <p>
                Throughout my work term, I substantially improved my ability to comprehend and apply technical documentation across multiple domains. I thoroughly studied dense computing research papers on NeRF models and large language model fine-tuning (originally for AgroNT), developing the ability to extract applicable concepts from academic literature and translate them into practical implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I gained proficiency with Python's CLI libraries by carefully working through their documentation, which proved essential for building effective command-line interfaces. The need to understand pymeshlab's extensive API documentation for 3D mesh manipulation was particularly challenging, requiring me to develop strategies for navigating complex technical specifications efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                My implementation work clearly demonstrated effective application of knowledge gained from documentation, as evidenced by the successful development of the 3D mesh pipeline and progress on the GWAS toolkit. When faced with undocumented behaviors or ambiguities, I developed a systematic approach to experimentation and validation that complemented my documentation-based learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ability to navigate, understand, and apply concepts from technical documentation proved invaluable across all projects, confirming that I met this learning goal. This skill development will continue to serve me well in future technical roles where self-directed learning through documentation is essential.
            </p>

            <!-- Learning Goal 3 -->
            <h4>Learning Goal 3</h4>
            <p>Publish a conference paper on my project towards the end of its development lifecycle.</p>
            <h4>Action Plan 3</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Document project findings in conference paper format</li>
                <li>Highlight project novelty and impact</li>
                <li>Iterate based on supervisor and peer review feedback</li>
                <li>Present at conference upon acceptance</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Measure of Success 3</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The successful creation of my research paper's manuscript, especially after several revisions according to my supervisor and other peer-reviewers' feedback would indicate that I achieved this goal</li>
                <li>The quality of writing in my submitted and revised manuscripts should indicate that the writing is clear, concise, and detailed, even to a non-technical audience, if this goal is to be said to have been achieved/met</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Reflection 3</h4>
            <p>
                While my original plan to publish a conference paper faced timeline challenges due to the project pivot, significant progress was made toward this goal. The GWAS toolkit project advanced to a promising state in the latter half of my work term, with preparations underway for a research manuscript to be completed before the May 8, 2025 submission deadline. Though publication will occur after my formal work term concludes, the groundwork has been thoroughly established.
            </p>
            <p>
                I did excel in written communication through the completion of 12 detailed project progress reports for Professor Lin's machine learning project. These reports successfully documented technical work in an accessible format, receiving positive feedback for their clarity and appropriate level of technical detail. The discipline of weekly reporting helped refine my ability to distill complex technical concepts into understandable narratives.
            </p>
            <p>
                This regular documentation practice enhanced my ability to communicate complex concepts to team members with varying technical backgrounds. I learned to calibrate technical depth based on audience needs—a skill directly applicable to research paper writing. These activities demonstrate substantial progress toward the goal of effective written communication in a research context, though full achievement awaits the conference paper submission.
            </p>

            <!-- Learning Goal 4 -->
            <h4>Learning Goal 4</h4>
            <p>Master Golang, Python, and PyTorch through practical application in the AgroNT project.</p>
            <h4>Action Plan 4</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Implement project components using identified technologies</li>
                <li>Develop comprehensive testing suites for quality assurance</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Measure of Success 4</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrated proficiency in using identified technologies</li>
                <li>Successful completion of majority project deliverables</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Reflection 4</h4>
            <p>
                During my work term, I significantly deepened my understanding of multiple programming technologies through practical application. With Golang, I progressed beyond basic syntax to mastering advanced concepts like closures and variable scope within loops. My Python skills expanded through CLI development and pipeline implementation, while PyTorch experience came through experimentation with NeRF models, including valuable exposure to NVIDIA GPU training via Google Colab.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 3D mesh pipeline project required extensive Python development, particularly for integrating complex libraries like pymeshlab and managing file transformations across various 3D formats (OBJ, PLY, GLB). This hands-on experience solidified my understanding of Python's object-oriented capabilities and module architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I revisited Docker and OS-based virtualization for the GWAS toolkit and began planning implementing data conversion components using Golang's Cobra CLI library. Each technology presented unique challenges that deepened my understanding of language-specific paradigms and best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The successful completion of deliverables across multiple projects demonstrates my growing proficiency with these technologies. Each project presented unique technical challenges that required deep engagement with these tools, confirming that I achieved meaningful growth in technical depth. This multi-language expertise has prepared me well for future roles requiring adaptability across technology stacks and the ability to select appropriate tools for specific development challenges.
            </p>

            <!-- Learning Goal 5 -->
            <h4>Learning Goal 5</h4>
            <p>Implement robust debugging and quality assurance processes.</p>
            <h4>Action Plan 5</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Develop comprehensive testing throughout development cycle</li>
                <li>Address bugs through root cause analysis and verified fixes</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Measure of Success 5</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>There should be a clear record of at-least ten important bug fixes throughout the project's development lifespan using version control software and other software documentation tools</li>
                <li>The fixes I apply to these bugs should work by reducing the number of defects in my system, and improving user experience when using the system</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Reflection 5</h4>
            <p>
                Throughout my work term, I implemented robust debugging and quality assurance processes across all three projects, with particularly notable applications in Professor Lin's project and the GWAS toolkit. While I maintained a proactive approach to code quality by writing careful implementations to minimize bugs from the outset, I successfully identified and resolved numerous issues through systematic debugging when they did arise.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 3D mesh pipeline, I encountered particularly challenging bugs related to mesh topology preservation during decimation operations. These issues required methodical investigation, including visualization of intermediate results and careful analysis of mesh properties before and after processing. The solutions implemented not only fixed immediate issues but improved overall pipeline robustness.
            </p>
            <p>
                A key insight from this experience was the critical importance of edge-case testing and comprehensive test coverage to identify bugs early in the development process. I developed a disciplined approach to problem isolation, root cause analysis, and solution verification that strengthened the overall quality of my deliverables. These experiences validated my achievement of this learning goal by demonstrating practical problem-solving capabilities in real-world development scenarios. The debugging skills cultivated during this work term have enhanced my technical toolkit and will serve as valuable assets in future development work.

            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <img src="../images/researcher_photograph0.png" alt="A Photo Representing Research Work" id="job-response-photo">
            <p>
                My work under Professor Lin and Yan's co-supervision involved a sizeable amount of technical (hard) and non-technical (soft) skills. The work was highly intriguing, and often challenging and novel, thus making my work-term more valuable as a learning experience. While it was regrettable the AgroNT project was killed towards the end of my work-term, I learned so much about deep learning and core bioinformatics techniques through it, and it paved the way for a more pragmatic and promising genome-wide association studies (GWAS) project right after its untimely end. In any case, below is a list of my job responsibilities that should serve as a useful summary of what I did for work during the work-term.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Gather, create, and maintain 2D image databases for the 3D model.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test and examine the existing workflows for generating 3D models using 2D images.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gather data and test existing bioinformatics models for analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create and maintain the research group website for the projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generate documentations during the projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And, write research manuscript summarizing the project work.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The key takeaway from working with various machine learning models in this work-term was: machine learning is mainly about compressing tremendous amounts of data into more digestable forms, and developing approximation functions to model many of life's phenomena. For example: NeRFs are a way to model reconstructing complex 3D scenes as closely as possible, and it uses a methematical model to approximate the task of recreating complex 3D scenes from training datasets. It is like asking a machine to look at a picture depicting a 3D scene, memorize the contents of the picture, and recreate it from memory without looking or referring to the original learning photograph. The mathematical model used here allows the computer (i.e., the "machine") to learn patterns from the input dataset so it can recreate the scene from memory as faithfully as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, and this being an academic position, I had to complete a lot of reading, especially of dense technical scientific literature in computer science and biology. I will say: the more experience I get in academia, the more I realize how poorly written much of contemporary academic literature really is. I lost count over the amount of times I got needlessly confused by verbose wording and phrasing, and the strange use of overly sophisticated terminology when simpler alternatives would work. Writing is really an art, and the best academics prove that it is regularly. You can know just about everything in a field, but being able to clearly communicate it to others in the written form is another challenge entirely. I hope if I continue in academia that I continue to develop this integral skill to pave the way for more accessible and useful science, and ultimately make the computing academic field better as a result.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, the work-term was an excellent learning experience, and I would do it all over again, if I could.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusions">
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                I worked as a researcher in computing at Algoma University from early January 2025 to late April 2025 for my fourth work-term. This job was a full-time role where I worked on deep learning models and GWAS toolkits for bioinformatics, and on a machine learning system for downscaling and upscaling real 3D meshes at will for a virtual reality project. My work incorporated learnings in bioinformatics, computer graphics, and machine learning, which are all fascinating subsets of the greater computer science field.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoyed this work-term as a learning and professional experience because of the novel subfields of computing it made me work in. There was ample challenge and learning to be completed, especially on the job, and it paid off in my current and future knowledge, skills, and aptitude (KSA) as a software developer and computer science researcher.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on what I have learned thus far from this work-term, I cannot underestimate the value of clear communication, especially in technical fields where poor writing is more often the norm rather than the exception. If there were only one thing I could take away from this work-term, it would be this lesson.
