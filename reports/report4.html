            </ol>
            <h4>Reflection 1</h4>
            <p>
                While my original goal involved developing a CLI pipeline for AgroNT, circumstances necessitated a pivot to another machine learning project under Professor Randy Lin's supervision. Instead of the intended gene expression prediction model, I successfully designed and implemented a CLI pipeline for a 3D mesh downscaler and upscaler project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using Python, I developed a system that automatically downscales/distorts 3D meshes from open-license databases like ShapeNet to create supervised training datasets for machine learning models such as NeRFs. The pipeline incorporated various open-source tools including pymeshlab and blender, demonstrating my ability to adapt to changing project requirements while maintaining technical rigor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although my involvement concluded at the NeRF dataset adaptation and conversion stage due to budgetary constraints, the project achieved significant progress. Professor Lin expressed high satisfaction with the completed work, validating that I successfully met the core technical objectives of designing and implementing a functional CLI pipeline for a machine learning application, albeit in a different domain than originally planned.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience highlighted the importance of flexibility in technical development while maintaining focus on delivering a reliable, well-documented system that meets user needs. The skills developed during this process—particularly in pipeline design, system integration, and technical documentation—will prove valuable in future software engineering endeavors regardless of the specific application domain.
